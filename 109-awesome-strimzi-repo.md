# Add `awesome-strimzi` repository with Strimzi community-created resources

This proposal recommends creating a new GitHub repository, `awesome-strimzi`, under the Strimzi organization.
Its purpose is to maintain a list of community-created resources related to Strimzi, such as blog posts, articles, libraries, frameworks, tools, and other useful materials that are not produced by official Strimzi contributors.

Examples include:

* libraries or SDKs that simplify interaction with Strimzi.
* blog posts, tutorials, or case studies highlighting Strimzi usage.
* community tools and integrations.

## Current situation

Currently, there is no dedicated place within the Strimzi project to showcase community-created content.

When users want to share articles or blog posts on their personal or company websites, or even tools or libraries related to Strimzi, there is no central location to collect and share these links.
This makes it harder for new and existing users to discover the broader ecosystem of community contributions around Strimzi.

## Motivation

Strimzi benefits from a vibrant community whose work extends far beyond the official project deliverables.
Having a central list will:

* showcase the breadth of the Strimzi ecosystem.
* help users discover useful external resources.
* encourage community contributions and collaboration.
* amplify the impact of Strimzi beyond the official channels.

## Proposal

This proposal is about creating a new `awesome-strimzi` repository on GitHub under the Strimzi organization where external resources related to Strimzi could be listed and referenced.
This approach seems to be commonly used for several subjects across the Internet, taking as examples the [awesome-amqp](https://github.com/xinchen10/awesome-amqp) and [awesome-kafka](https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-kafka).
These are not official, whereas we would like to have an official one within the Strimzi project to make it clear that such resources are all "approved" by the Strimzi contributors.

Create a new GitHub repository named `awesome-strimzi` within the Strimzi organization.

This repository will:

* follow the popular awesome list format used across other projects.
* contain categorized links to external Strimzi-related resources.
* be maintained by Strimzi contributors, ensuring the content is relevant, appropriate, and not used as a "sales pitch" with spam or similar.

An official Strimzi‑hosted list would give added visibility and credibility to community contributions.

The repository will contain two main files:

* README.md with an introduction to the purpose of `awesome-strimzi` and a list of resources.
* CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributing to the list.

The main content, within the README.md file, will be structured the following way:

* Official Resources
    * links to Strimzi’s official docs and repos (for quick reference).
* Getting Started
    * onboarding materials for new users, i.e. link to Strimzi quick start guide and blog posts introducing Strimzi basics.
* Articles & Blog Posts
    * community-written articles, tutorials, and technical deep-dives.
* Talks & Presentations
    * conference talks, webinars, and meetups.
* Libraries & SDKs
    * community-developed code to help work with Strimzi/Kafka.
* Tools & Utilities
    * CLI tools, monitoring dashboards, configuration helpers.
* Integrations
    * how Strimzi works with other platforms or frameworks.
* Community Examples & Demos
    * real-world Strimzi setups, PoCs, sample projects.
* Learning & Tutorials
    * structured learning resources, workshops, and self-paced guides.

The CONTRIBUTING.md would include clear instructions about:

* how to open a PR.
* submission format (title, short description, link).
* guidelines about what should be considered as an appropiate contribution.
