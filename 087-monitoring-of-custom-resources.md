# Monitoring of custom resources

In [issue #9802](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/9802) there was a discussion about how to monitor the state of a custom resources (CR) like `KafkaTopic`, `KafkaUser`, and so on.
For a simple and Kubernetes native monitoring, [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) (KSM) can be used which utilizes e.g. the status object of a Kubernetes resource.

## Current situation

All Strimzi operators (Cluster, User and Topic operators) provide metrics in Prometheus format.
However, currently, only the Cluster Operator provides a metric (`strimzi_resource_state`) describing the state of the custom resources (whether they are ready or not).
It provides this metric for the `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaBridge`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, `KafkaMirrorMaker2`, and `KafkaRebalance` custom resources.
Currently, it does not provide this metric for `KafkaNodePool`, `KafkaConnector`, and `StrimziPodSet` custom resources.
The User and Topic Operators currently do not provide this metric for the `KafkaUser` and `KafkaTopic` custom resources.
Examples:

```
$ curl -s localhost:8080/metrics | grep strimzi_resource_state
# HELP strimzi_resource_state Current state of the resource: 1 ready, 0 fail
# TYPE strimzi_resource_state gauge
strimzi_resource_state{kind="Kafka",name="my-cluster",reason="none",resource_namespace="myproject",} 1.0
strimzi_resource_state{kind="KafkaConnect",name="my-connect",reason="none",resource_namespace="myproject",} 1.0
```

## Motivation

Strimzi already provides example configurations being compatible with the prometheus-operator via e.g. `PodMonitor` for scraping the metrics and e.g. `PrometheusRules` for alerting.

In general, you want to be notified if a deployed Kubernetes resource encounters a problem or uses a deprecated configuration, so you can address the issue promptly.
Other tools like Flux handles the monitoring of CRs via KSM like documented in their [documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/monitoring/custom-metrics/).
In addition, Flux provides an [example repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-monitoring-example) for configuring KSM as part of [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) Helm chart.
But the required configuration is just being part of the ConfigMap used by KSM as shown by @im-konge in this [issue](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/10276#issuecomment-2276088493).

## Proposal

So in order to have a monitoring in place for all CRs and implementing them in a scalable and Kubernetes native way KSM can be used.
KSM is (mostly) deployed via a simple Kubernetes `Deployment` and queries the Kubernetes api for e.g. the status object of a Kubernetes resource indicating that the CR having a problem or contains a deprecated configuration.
This can also be done for CRs exclusively by using the `--custom-resource-state-config` flag which is helpful for e.g. `KafkaTopic`, `KafkaUser`, ... CRs.
During the initial phase when implementing this proposal, the support in the examples will be implemented at least for the existing resources for which Strimzi publishes already existing metrics, additionally for `KafkaUser` and `KafkaTopic` custom resources.

### Deployment

Strimzi should provide guidance for existing fields in status object in order to indicate if a CR is having a problem or uses a deprecated configuration in the official documentation.
By this users can extend monitoring of CRs on their own requirements.

In general, an example ConfigMap should be provided in the examples (sub-)directory `metrics/kube-state-metrics` of [strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/main/examples/metrics/kube-state-metrics) to specify a good starting configuration for users.
The ConfigMap should look like e.g.:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
  name: strimzi-kube-state-metrics-config
data:
  config.yaml: |
    spec:
      resources:
      - groupVersionKind:
          group: kafka.strimzi.io
          version: v1beta2
          kind: KafkaTopic
        metricNamePrefix: strimzi_kafka_topic
        metrics:
          - name: resource_info
            help: "The current state of a Strimzi kafka topic resource"
            each:
              type: Info
              info:
                labelsFromPath:
                  name: [ metadata, name ]
            labelsFromPath:
              exported_namespace: [ metadata, namespace ]
              partitions: [ spec, partitions ]
              replicas: [ spec, replicas ]
              ready: [ status, conditions, "[type=Ready]", status ]
              generation: [ status, observedGeneration ]
              topicId: [ status, topicId ]
              topicName: [ status, topicName ]
      - ...
```

For users deploying Kubernetes manifests as plain YAML, the ConfigMap works fine when creating a dedicated deployment of KSM.

This works also fine when implementing the configuration inside [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) Helm chart.

For (all other) Helm users, this should be left to the user implementing the KSM based monitoring, as there are many different Helm charts but all of them will handle the same ConfigMap in the end.
This could be explained in a Blog Post with a static version of the [prometheus-community kube-state-metrics Helm chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-state-metrics/) at least once.

In addition, Strimzi will define example `PrometheusRules` for all CRs having issues or using deprecated configuration in a simple way, so that the Cluster Operator look for an error message in the status object of the CR.
[This PR](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/10277) could be used as an implementation idea.

## Affected/not affected projects

The only affected projects are:
- CO

## Compatibility

Strimzi provides the `strimzi_resource_state` metric(s) implemented in CO.

The previously elaborated metrics(s) should be deprecated and replaced in favor of KSM based metrics which means that KSM will be responsible for providing these metrics instead of CO.
Due to this change, the metric names, labels and format will change.

The pattern for new metrics will look like `strimzi_` + `<custom_resource>` + `_resource_info{<all_exposed_fields>}`

Example for a `Kafka` metric:
```
strimzi_kafka_resource_info{customresource_group="kafka.strimzi.io",customresource_kind="Kafka",customresource_version="v1beta2",exported_namespace="kafka",generation="1",kafka_metadata_state="KRaft",kafka_metadata_version="3.8-IV0",kafka_version="3.8.0",name="my-kafka-cluster",cluster_id="asdfasdfasdfasdf",operator_last_successful_version="0.43.0",ready="True"}
```

Example for a `KafkaUser` metric:
```
strimzi_kafka_user_resource_info{customresource_group="kafka.strimzi.io",customresource_kind="KafkaUser",customresource_version="v1beta2",exported_namespace="kafka",generation="6",name="my-kafka-user",ready="True",secret="my-kafka-user",username="CN=my-kafka-user"} 1
```

Example for a `KafkaTopic` metric:
```
strimzi_kafka_topic_resource_info{customresource_group="kafka.strimzi.io",customresource_kind="KafkaTopic",customresource_version="v1beta2",exported_namespace="kafka",generation="1",name="my-kafka-topic",partitions="12",ready="True",replicas="3",topicId="asdfasdfasdfasdf",topicName="my-kafka-topic"} 1
```
This also applies for PrometheusRules which should be replaced.
The proposed way would be implementing the KSM and deprecating the current metrics in Strimzi CO in version 0.45 and removing them in version 0.49 to give users enough time adjusting their monitoring if needed.
So there is no immediate impact for users and enough time for migration.

## Rejected alternatives

Implementing them inside each operator (CO, TO, UO) which leads to enormous metrics exported by each component as discussed in this [issue](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/9802).
