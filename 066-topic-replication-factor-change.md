# Topic replication factor change

In Kafka, the unit of replication is the topic partition.
The total number of partition replicas, including the leader, constitutes the replication factor.

The replication factor is configured at the topic level, and can be used to enable strong durability and fault tolerance.
When the Kafka cluster is healthy and a broker is down, another broker can serve the data of topics with a replication factor greater than one.
A tradeoff of replication is that each topic partition will take up an amount of storage equal to its size multiplied by the replication factor value.
The cluster-wide `default.replication.factor` configuration is used when a new topic is created without specifying a replication factor at the topic level.

When new messages arrive, they are first written into the operating system's page cache, and then flushed to disk asynchronously.
If the Kafka JVM crashes for whatever reason, recent messages are still in the page cache, and can be flushed by the operating system.
However, this doesn't protect from data loss when the machine crashes, and this is why enabling topic replication is important.
To further improve fault tolerance, a rack-aware Kafka cluster can be used to distribute topic replicas evenly across data centers in the same geographic region.

Once a topic is created, it is possible to change its replication factor using a command line tool, but not directly through the topic configuration.
This operation is quite complicated on busy clusters with thousands of partitions, because the user has to decide leader and partition movements without causing a cluster unbalance.

The goal of this proposal is to allow Strimzi users to change the topic replication factor by simply updating the KafkaTopic resource, which is managed by the Topic Operator.
Unless otherwise stated in this proposal, all references to the Topic Operator assume the Unidirectional implementation.

## Current situation

When users change the `.spec.replicas` property of a KafkaTopic, the Topic Operator fails the reconciliation process and the status of the KafkaTopic resource changes to _not ready_.
An error is reported in Topic Operator logs and KafkaTopic resource status.

> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,\
> 22, 23, 24]

The only [documented solution](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/deploying#proc-changing-topic-replicas-str) is to use the kafka-reassign-partitions.sh tool by spinning up a separate interactive pod.
This is far from user friendly, and the user is in charge of doing the calculations to determine the best broker to host a new replica, or which replica needs to be dropped.

When data loss is not a problem, the user can simply delete and recreate the KafkaTopic resource with the desired replication factor.
This is not really an option for most use cases.

## Motivation

The topic replication factor change feature will provide a much better cloud-native experience for Strimzi users.
They will be able to change the topic replication factor by simply updating the KafkaTopic resource, which may also happen through a GitOps pipeline.

This is a non exhaustive list of use cases that will become significantly easier:

- Set a lower replication factor for non-critical topics to reduce the infrastructure costs (compute, storage and network).
- Set a lower replication factor to deal with resource shortage (trade-off between fault-tolerance and resource utilization).
- Set a higher replication factor for critical topics to improve durability and fault tolerance.

A tighter integration with Cruise Control is also one of the long term goals of the Strimzi project. 

## Proposal

The replication factor change feature can be implemented by integrating the Topic Operator with Cruise Control.
The Cluster Operator is already integrated with Cruise Control, so we can factor out the existing logic and classes.

Cruise Control creates a task for each operation, such as topic configuration and cluster rebalance.
A task is first created in the Active state, then moves to InExecution, and finally to Completed or CompletedWithError.
At most `max.active.user.tasks` tasks can be Active at the same time (5 by default), and only one task can be InExecution at any given time.

During the execution, a task is divided in one or more batches, which are then executed one after the other.
If any batch fails then the task becomes `CompletedWithError` potentially leaving some topics in a changed state and others unchanged.
A completed task is retained for `completed.user.task.retention.time.ms`, which defaults to 24 hours.

### Topic configuration

The [`topic_configuration`](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/REST-APIs#change-kafka-topic-configuration) endpoint will be used to request replication factor changes.
Once accepted, the replication factor change is put into the Cruise Control's task queue and executed asynchronously with respect to the sending of the HTTP response to the request that initiated the change.

The two required parameters for this endpoint are `topic` (regular expression to specify subject topics) and `replication_factor` (target replication factor).
In order to group multiple changes in the same request to Cruise Control, the Topic Operator uses a [JSON payload](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/Change-topic-replication-factor-through-Cruise-Control#instruction), which replaces the required parameters.
This JSON contains a list of replication factor values, each one associated with a regex expression of the form `topic1|topic2|topic3` matching all topics with that target replication factor.

This is useful with bulk replicas changes, which can happen in some edge cases.
A potentially big backlog of changes may be created when the Topic Operator is not running, or there is an issue with Cruise Control or Kafka.
Another example is a GitOps pipeline delivering many replicas changes at the same time to reduce the storage occupation of non-critical topics.

```sh
$ curl -vv -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{replication_factor:{topic_by_replication_factor:{2:topic1|topic3|topic4,3:topic2|topic5}}}' \

The `skip_rack_awareness_check` parameter configures whether to skip the rack awareness sanity check or not (default to false).
If rack awareness is not enabled in Strimzi, the `skip_rack_awareness_check` will be set to true.

The `goals` parameter is a comma-separated list of goals used to generate the automatic cluster rebalance for the replication factor change.
This is configurable for all endpoints in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config` using the `default.goals` property.

The `replication_throttle` parameter is an upper bound on the bandwidth used to move replicas (bytes per second).
This is configurable for all endpoints in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config` using the `default.replication.throttle` property.

### User tasks

The [`user_tasks`](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/REST-APIs#query-the-user-request-result) endpoint will be used to periodically check the state of requested tasks.
The only required parameter is the `user_task_ids`, which is a comma-separated list of `User-Task-ID` values returned by the topic configuration requests.

```sh
$ curl -s "localhost:9090/kafkacruisecontrol/user_tasks?user_task_ids=5344ca89-351f-4565-8d0f-9aade00e053d,8911ca89-351f-888-8d0f-9aade00e098h&json=true" | jq

    }
  ],
  "version": 1
}
```

### Configuration parameters

The Topic Operator will need to authenticate and send HTTP requests to the Cruise Control's REST API.
A new admin user will be provisioned for the Topic Operator, separate from the credentials used by the KafkaRebalanceOperator.
The following environment variables will be set by the Cluster Operator for consumption by the Topic Operator when Cruise Control is configured in the Kafka resource, or manually by the user in case of standalone deployment:

| Name                                  | Type    | Default | Description                                                   |
|:--------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_ENABLED        | Boolean | false   | Whether Cruise Control integration is enabled                 |
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_RACK_ENABLED   | Boolean | false   | Whether rack awareness is enabled in the target Kafka cluster |
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_HOSTNAME       | String  | ""      | Cruise Control hostname                                       |
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_PORT           | Integer | 9090    | Cruise Control port                                           |
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_SSL_ENABLED    | Boolean | false   | Whether SSL encryption is enabled                             |
| STRIMZI_CRUISE_CONTROL_AUTH_ENABLED   | Boolean | false   | Whether Basic authentication is enabled                       |

With the Cluster Operator deployment, the certificate chain in PEM format and the admin user credentials for the Cruise Control REST API will be automatically mounted in the Topic Operator container.
Whereas in the standalone deployment, the user will have to mount: certificate chain in `/etc/tls-sidecar/cluster-ca-certs/ca.crt`, credentials in `/etc/eto-cc-api/topic-operator.apiAdminName`, and `/etc/eto-cc-api/topic-operator.apiAdminPassword`.

### KafkaTopic CRD changes

During the whole replicas change process the KafkaTopic will remain in a ready state.
A replicas change will be executed asynchronously, taking more than one reconciliation to complete.

A new optional KafkaTopicStatus subsection called `replicasChange` will be used to update the user, and keep track of the replicas change state.
The `replicasChange` can be in a pending or ongoing `state`, and it can contain a `message` in case of failure.
Other fields are `sessionId`, which maps to Cruise Control's `User-Task-ID`, and `targetReplicas`, which reflects the target replicas value (this may be different from `.spec.replicas` when the state is ongoing).

- **Pending**: Not in Cruise Control's task queue (not yet sent or request error).
  Cruise Control's task states: None.
  ```sh
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-18T16:13:50.490918232Z"
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    observedGeneration: 2
    replicasChange:
      state: pending
      targetReplicas: 2
    topicName: my-topic
  ```

- **Ongoing**: In Cruise Control's task queue, but execution not started, or not completed. 
  Cruise Control's task states: Active, InExecution.
  ```sh
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-18T16:13:53.490918232Z"
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    observedGeneration: 3
    replicasChange:
      sessionId: 1aa418ca-53ed-4b93-b0a4-58413c4fc0cb
      state: ongoing
      targetReplicas: 2
    topicName: my-topic
  ```

- **Completed**: Cruise Control's task execution completed (target replication factor reconciled).
  This is characterised by the absence of a `replicasChange` status.
  Cruise Control's task states: Completed.
  ```sh
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-18T16:13:58.490918232Z"
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    observedGeneration: 4
    topicName: my-topic
  ```

- **Failed**: Cruise Control's request failed, the change remains pending, and it is periodically retried.
  Cruise Control's task states: CompletedWithError.
  ```sh
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-18T16:13:58.490918232Z"
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    observedGeneration: 4
    replicasChange:
      message: Change request failed, Cluster model not ready
      state: pending
      targetReplicas: 2
    topicName: my-topic
  ```

### Reconciliation logic

At runtime, the Topic Operator watches and periodically reconciles the configuration of all managed and unpaused KafkaTopic resources.
Among the other configurations, the reconciliation logic detects `.spec.replicas` changes in KafkaTopic resources by comparing with the topic replication factor value in Kafka.

A ReplicasChangeClient will be used to isolate the logic required to call the Cruise Control REST API from the rest of the reconciliation logic.
The ReplicasChangeClient will support sending multiple replicas changes with a single request, and checking multiple tasks with a single request.

On every reconciliation loop, when Cruise Control integration is enabled and replicas changes are detected, the BatchingTopicController will use the ReplicasChangeClient for the following operations:

1. Request pending replicas changes (uses `topic_configuration` endpoint, and returns topics with pending and ongoing changes).
2. Check ongoing replicas changes (uses `user_tasks` endpoint, and returns topics with completed changes).

The result of these operations will be used to update the KafkaTopic status.

### Error handling

In case of error, the error message will be added to the KafkaTopic status and printed in logs, but the replicas change will remain pending or ongoing, and will be indefinitely retried by the periodic reconciliation.

In Cruise Control, there is no way to differentiate between temporary errors (resolve by themselves) and from permanent errors (require some action).
For example, the `NotEnoughValidWindowsException` can be raised when Cruise Control has just started and the cluster model is still building, but also when there is a configuration error which prevents broker metrics collection.
A similar example is the `OptimizationFailureException` raised when some hard goal is violated, which can be temporary if the configured network capacity is less than the real network capacity and there is a traffic peak.
The `OngoingExecutionException` is clearly temporary, and it means that a task execution was attempted while there is already one that is being executed by Cruise Control.
Another temporary example is the `RuntimeException` when Cruise Control's task queue is full.

Cruise Control allows scale down of the replication factor under the `min.insync.replicas` value, which can cause disruption to producers with `acks=all`.
When this happens, the Topic Operator won't block the operation, but will just log a warning, because the KafkaRoller ignores topics with RF < minISR, and they don't even show up as under replicated in Kafka metrics.
The target replication factor should also be less than or equal to the number of available brokers, but this is enforced directly by Cruise Control.

When a managed KafkaTopic with a replicas change is deleted in Kubernetes, the Topic Operator will also delete the topic in Kafka, but the current batch execution will continue in Cruise Control.
There is little benefit in using the `stop_proposal_execution` endpoint, because most tasks to change replicas have only one batch.

When a managed topic with a replicas change is deleted in Kafka, the Topic Operator will recreate the topic with the target replication factor.

When the Topic Operator is restarted, both pending and ongoing replicas changes will be recovered from the KafkaTopic status.
The ongoing state will include a `sessionId`, which serves as the unique identifier for a Cruise Control task involving one or more replica changes.

When Cruise Control is restarted, all active tasks are lost because there is no persistent memory.
The Topic Operator will detect this event when the ongoing changes check returns no tasks for a known `sessionId`.
All pending and ongoing replicas changes will still be stored in KafkaTopic status, and new tasks will be created as soon as Cruise Control becomes ready.

## Affected/not affected projects

### Topic Operator

This component will drive the whole replication factor change process.
The Cruise Control integration logic will be isolated in a new ReplicasChangeClient object.

### Cluster Operator

This component will be responsible for initializing the environment variables and mounting the Cruise Control API secret.

Mounting the existing Cruise Control API secret into the Topic Operator would require deploying Cruise Control before the Topic Operator, creating a strong dependency between these two components.
To avoid that, the Topic Operator will create it's own API secret containing a dedicated admin username and password, while Cruise Control will add the secret content to its API credentials store.
This logic will be triggered only when they are both enabled in the Kafka resource.

The Entity Operator reconciler will detect any API secret change, and restart the Entity Operator pod to load the new credentials.

## Compatibility

There is no backward compatibility issue for this proposal.

## Rejected alternatives

- Use a ReplicasChangeManager object to drive the replicas change reconciliation, which is notified by the BatchingTopicController. 
  This makes the implementation way more complicated because this new object needs to maintain an in-memory cache of ongoing changes.
