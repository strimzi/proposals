# Restarting Kafka Connect connectors and tasks

This proposal adds support for restarting Kafka Connect connectors and connector tasks via annotations added to the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resources and via overridable default behaviour of the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators.


## Current situation

When Kafka Connect connectors or tasks throw uncaught exceptions, the Kafka Connect framework stops the connector/task and puts it into a `FAILED` state. The Kafka Connect REST API includes two endpoints to restart a connector and a task:
 - `POST /connectors/{connector-name}/restart`
 - `POST /connectors/{connector-name}/tasks/{task-id}/restart`
Sending a request to one of these endpoints will cause the Connect framework to restart the connector/task.

Currently, the Strimzi operators do not have any special handling for connectors or tasks that are in the `FAILED` state. Users must make HTTP POST requests to the Connect restart endpoints if they want to restart a connector/task.

A connector/task does not need to be in the `FAILED` state to be restarted via the Connect REST API; a connector or task can be restarted at any time. Restarting a connector or task causes the Connect framework to re-initialise the connector/task and reactivate message processing. Note that restarting a connector does not restart its tasks.

The default network policies created by the Strimzi operators restrict incoming Connect REST API calls to only allow access from the operator pod, so users must add supplementary network policies to be able to make calls to the restart REST APIs.


## Motivation

Enabling users to restart connectors and tasks means there are almost (1) no further Connect REST APIs that users must call to interact with connectors/tasks when using CRs that create connectors. This means the CRs and their operators can exclusively be used to manage connectors and tasks - Strimzi users do not have to call the Connect REST API directly. As a corollary, this means the Connect REST listener does not need to be available to users; it could be secured so that only the operator can interact with the REST API.

(1) - Kafka 2.5 introduced the `GET /connectors/{connector-name}/topics` Connect endpoint to list the topics that a connector has used since the connector was created or the list was reset. Kafka 2.5 also introduced the `PUT /connectors/{connector-name}/topics/reset` Connect endpoint to clear the list of topics that a connector has used.


## Proposal

This proposal adds two new separate but related features:

1. New annotations that cause the operator to restart connectors or tasks. They can be applied to the `KafkaConnector`, and the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resources. The annotation acts as a trigger for a single restart call by the operator, and is removed from the CR when the restart REST API call is successfully called.

2. New default behaviour in the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators that automatically attempts to restart connectors and tasks if they are in the `FAILED` state. The `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` CRs can use a new field in the spec to disable the automatic restarting behaviour if required.

These two features could be delivered separately as they do not rely on each other.


### `strimzi.io/restart` annotation

An annotation named `strimzi.io/restart` can be applied to the `KafkaConnector` custom resource. The CR it is applied to determines the connector that is restarted. Once the operator successfully calls the restart REST API endpoint, the CR is patched to remove the annotation. If the restart REST API endpoint does not return a successful (HTTP 200 OK) response, the operator will continue to attempt to call the restart REST API endpoint once per reconcile cycle.

When applied to a `KafkaConnector` CR, the connector defined by the CR is restarted. Any value can be assigned to the annotation. For example:
```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: my-source-connector
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/restart: "true"
  ...
```

### `strimzi.io/restart-connector` annotation

An annotation named `strimzi.io/restart-connector` can be applied to the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource. The value of the annotation and the CR it is applied to determines the connector that is restarted. Once the operator successfully calls the restart REST API endpoint, the CR is patched to remove the annotation. If the restart REST API endpoint does not return a successful (HTTP 200 OK) response, the operator will continue to attempt to call the restart REST API endpoint once per reconcile cycle.

When applied to a `KafkaMirrorMaker2` CR, the annotation value contains the name of the connector that is restarted. For example:
```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
metadata:
  name: my-mm2-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/restart: "source-cluster->target-cluster.MirrorSourceConnector"
  ...
```

### `strimzi.io/restart-task` annotation

An annotation named `strimzi.io/restart-task` can be applied to the `KafkaConnector` custom resources. The value of the annotation and the CR it is applied to determines the connector task that is restarted. Once the operator successfully calls the restart REST API endpoint, the CR is patched to remove the annotation. If the restart REST API endpoint does not return a successful (HTTP 200 OK) response, the operator will continue to attempt to call the restart REST API endpoint once per reconcile cycle.

When applied to a `KafkaConnector` CR, the annotation value contains the ID of the task that is restarted. For example:
```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: my-source-connector
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/restart-task: "0"
  ...
```

### `strimzi.io/restart-connector-task` annotation

An annotation named `strimzi.io/restart-connector-task` can be applied to the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource. The value of the annotation and the CR it is applied to determines the connector task that is restarted. Once the operator successfully calls the restart REST API endpoint, the CR is patched to remove the annotation. If the restart REST API endpoint does not return a successful (HTTP 200 OK) response, the operator will continue to attempt to call the restart REST API endpoint once per reconcile cycle.

When applied to a `KafkaMirrorMaker2` CR, the annotation value contains the name of the connector and the ID of the task that is restarted, delimited by a `:` character. For example:

```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
metadata:
  name: my-mm2-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/restart-task: "source-cluster->target-cluster.MirrorSourceConnector:2"
  ...
```


### Automatically restarting `FAILED` connectors and tasks

The `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators will have new default behaviour that automatically restarts connectors or tasks that are in the `FAILED` state. For each connector or task that is in the `FAILED` state, the operator will call the Connect REST API `restart` endpoint once per reconcile cycle to attempt to restart the connector/task.

To disable the new default behaviour a new field in the `KafkaConnector` spec named `autoRestart` with an `enabled` field value of `false` can be applied. This will be useful when users know that external factors will cause connectors/tasks to be in the `FAILED` state and they do not want the operator attempting automatic restarts. It also means users can keep the current behaviour of the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators if they wish.

For example, the following `KafkaConnector` CR disables the automatic restarting of the connector and it's tasks when they are in the `FAILED` state:
```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: my-source-connector
spec:
  autoRestart:
    enabled: false
  ...
```

Similarly, a new field in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` spec named `autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks` with an `enabled` field value of `false` can be applied, to disable auto-restarting connectors and tasks.

For example, the following `KafkaMirrorMaker2` CR disables the automatic restarting of the connector and it's tasks when they are in the `FAILED` state:
```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
metadata:
  name: my-mm2-cluster
spec:
  autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks:
    enabled: false
  ...
```


#### Repeated automatic restarts

Connectors and tasks that are in the `FAILED` state and are automatically restarted might cause other connectors and tasks to be rebalanced across the Kafka Connect cluster.
If the connectors and tasks repeatedly transition to the `FAILED` state, repeated auto-restarts could be detrimental to the health of the Kafka Connect cluster.
A back-off algorithm is applied to automatic restarts of each connector and it's tasks, incrementing the time between automatic restarts by 2 minutes, up to a maximum of 30 minutes, at which point no further automatic restarts are attempted, and the connector or tasks are left in the `FAILED` state.

For example, if a connector repeatedly transitions to the `FAILED` state, it is automatically restarted at minute 0, 2, 6, 12, 20 and 30.


#### Status of automatic restarts

A new field in the resource `status` records the number of times that connectors and tasks have been auto-restarted. The restart count is incremented every time the restart REST API is invoked and record the time when it was last auto-restarted:

In the `KafkaConnector` resource, the field is named `autoRestart`. For example:

```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
...
status:
  autoRestart:
    count: 2
    lastRestartTimestamp: "2020-07-13T21:59:09.832Z"
```

In the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource, the field is named `autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks` and records the number of times that each connector has been auto-restarted. For example:

```
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
...
status:
  autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks:
  - count: 2
    connectorName: "source-cluster->target-cluster.MirrorSourceConnector"
    lastRestartTimestamp: "2020-07-13T21:59:09.832Z"
  - count: 1
    connectorName: "source-cluster->target-cluster.MirrorCheckpointConnector"
    lastRestartTimestamp: "2020-07-14T20:55:34.678Z"
```

## Compatibility

Automatically restarting connectors and tasks in the `FAILED` state means that the default behaviour of the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators will be slightly different. This can be overridden using the `spec.autoRestart` and `spec.autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks` fields if desired.


## Rejected Alternatives

The default behaviour of the `KafkaConnector` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` operators could be left as-is, and the new `spec.autoRestart` and `spec.autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks` fields could be applied to explicitly set to `true` to enable the automatic restarting behaviour. It was felt that the most useful 'Kubernetes-native' behaviour would be to attempt automatic restarts, in a similar way to how failing pods are recreated by their parent deployments.
